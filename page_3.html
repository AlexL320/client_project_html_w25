            <h2>Critical Incident Support and Conflict Management</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone deserves to be in an environment where they feel safe and respected. When a conflict or critical incident 
                impacts your education and wellbeing, it shouldn't go unresolved. Turn to these resources for help finding support.
            </p>
            <h2>Finance</h2>
            <img src = "images/UM_Basic_Needs_Finance.jpg" alt = "A person is counting money">
            <p>
                Students may find it difficult to make ends meet, especially with the demands of classes, papers and exams.
                But you don't have to do it alone. If you're facing financial issues or concerns, these resources are available to assist.
            </p>
            <h2>Food</h2>
            <p>
                Students should go to class hungry for knowledge, not for food. If you can't afford balanced meals or sacrifice food to 
                pay for bills, know that you don't have to choose. Turn to these resources for help.
            </p>
            <h2>Health Care</h2>
            <img src = "images/UM_Basic_Needs_Healthcare.jpg" alt = "A stethoscope on a tape">
            <p>
                An important part of being away at college is remembering to take care of yourself. From scheduling an annual checkup to 
                seeking emergency care, you have options for making your health a priority.
            </p>
            <h2>Housing & Transportation</h2>
            <img src = "images/UM_Basic_Needs_Transportation.jpg" alt = "Students wait at a bus stop a bus come in to stop">
            <p>
                Students have a lot to consider when heading off to college. Where will I live? How will I get to class? Is there a bus to
                the grocery store? Use these resources to find answers for all of your questions and needs.
            </p>
            <h2>Careers at U-M</h2>
            <p>
