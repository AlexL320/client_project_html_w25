                Everyone deserves to be in an environment where they feel safe and respected. When a conflict or critical incident 
                impacts your education and wellbeing, it shouldn't go unresolved. Turn to these resources for help finding support.

                <p>
                    Students should go to class hungry for knowledge, not for food. If you can't afford balanced meals or sacrifice food to 
                    pay for bills, know that you don't have to choose. Turn to these resources for help.

                    An important part of being away at college is remembering to take care of yourself. From scheduling an annual checkup to 
                    seeking emergency care, you have options for making your health a priority.

                    Students have a lot to consider when heading off to college. Where will I live? How will I get to class? Is there a bus to
                    the grocery store? Use these resources to find answers for all of your questions and needs.
